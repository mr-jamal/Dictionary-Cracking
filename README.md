I recently created a directory cracking tool using Python, aimed at uncovering hidden directories within web applications. This tool employs techniques such as brute force and wordlist-based attacks to systematically probe for directories and files that might be inadvertently exposed. By integrating with widely-used wordlists and utilizing efficient HTTP request handling, the tool is designed to quickly and accurately identify potential security weaknesses. This project underscores my proficiency in web security and my ability to develop practical solutions for identifying vulnerabilities, thereby contributing to more robust and secure web applications.
